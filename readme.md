# Wordpress Elixir

## Introduction

Based on Jefrey Way Laravel Elixir thats provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your Laravel application. Elixir supports several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors, and even testing tools. I made a Wordpress functional elixir.

If you've ever been confused about how to get started with Gulp and asset compilation, you will love Laravel Elixir! and if you work with Wordpress you'll love Wordpress-Elixir.


## Official Documentation
